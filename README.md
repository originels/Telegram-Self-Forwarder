# Telegram-Self-Forwarder
This Telegram selfbot script automatically forwards the latest message posted in a source group to all other groups and channels where the Telegram account is a member, at regular intervals. As long as the script is running, it periodically fetches the newest message from the source group and forwards it to each connected group or channel.
